The Tool Kit Browser (aka: Web Tool Kit) is a [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) based browser (like Safari) that tracks information regarding the pages visited.  It tracks all resources loaded and the time associated with the load.  It can track what actions a user took (what links were clicked and information about the forms submitted) and records the cookies supplied to the server.

This browser is not meant for general browsing, but for troubleshooting web pages and [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) behavior on sites.
